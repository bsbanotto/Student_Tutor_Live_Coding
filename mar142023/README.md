Here's a bunch of files that are going to be used for singly linked list
live coding!

The purpose of the main file is to add nodes to a singly linked list to
transform the following sentence
  "My animal AXOLOTL!!"

to this sentence
  "My favorite animal is the AXOLOTL!!"

It's important to see that the memory address of any node does not
change when new nodes are inserted before it.
