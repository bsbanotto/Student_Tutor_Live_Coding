README for Live Coding on September 13, 2023.

We're covering Test Driven Development

doctest
unittest

The slide show provides a quick introduction to both testing modules and
thoughts on when to use one over the other.

In our doctest example, we are going to be making a list of integers and
writing test cases.

In our unittest example, we will be adding two integers and calculating the
area of a circle.

Command to run unittests:
 - python3 -m unittest -v discover

Command to run doctests:
 - python3 -m doctest -v doctest_example.py
